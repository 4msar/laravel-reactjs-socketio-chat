## Install LaraChat
```
git clone https://github.com/aligalipcamli/laravel-reactjs-socketio-chat.git
```
```
cd laravel-reactjs-socketio-chat
```
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
```
php composer.phar install
```
```
php composer.phar run-script all
```
Set database connection in .env file. For sqlite, make sure you write the absolute path.
```
php artisan migrate
```
```
npm install
```
```
php artisan serve
```
It tries to serve on port 8000. Open a new tab in the terminal and in the root directory, type:
```
./node_modules/laravel-echo-server/bin/server.js init
```
Steps should look like these:
```
? Do you want to run this server in development mode? Yes
? Which port would you like to serve from? 6001
? Which database would you like to use to store presence channel members? redis
? Enter the host of your Laravel authentication server. http://localhost:8000
? Will you be serving on http or https? http
? Do you want to generate a client ID/Key for HTTP API? Yes
? Do you want to setup cross domain access to the API? No
? What do you want this config to be saved as? laravel-echo-server.json
appId: 0bd9a970d761cae2
key: ba6e6627e0ef39847a72adb81caf0a2f
Configuration file saved. Run laravel-echo-server start to run server.

```
laravel-echo-server.json file is created. Beware that the port of the laravel authentication server is 8000 when artisan is served as default.
```
./node_modules/laravel-echo-server/bin/server.js start
```
Open http://localhost:8000 in the browser.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
